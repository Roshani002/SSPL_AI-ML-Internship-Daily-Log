# Customer Churn Prediction using Deep Learning 💡

This project builds an end-to-end deep learning model to predict telecom customer churn using an artificial neural network (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Predict which customers are likely to churn (leave the company) based on service usage data.

## 📌 Key Highlights
- Cleaned and preprocessed the raw dataset (`customer_churn_5june.csv`)
- Performed EDA to understand churn distribution and key influencing features
- Converted categorical variables using one-hot encoding
- Handled imbalanced data using:
  - Random Over Sampling
  - SMOTE
  - SMOTE + Tomek Links
  - SMOTE + Edited Nearest Neighbours (ENN)
- Built and trained a Deep Learning model using:
  - TensorFlow/Keras ANN
  - Evaluated with Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
